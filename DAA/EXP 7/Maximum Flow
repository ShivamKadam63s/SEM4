The Ford-Fulkerson function.
It follows the pseudocode:

  for each edge (u,v) in G: f(u,v) = 0
  while there exists a path p from s to t in the residual network Gf:
      cf(p) = min { c_f(u,v) for (u,v) in p }
      for each edge (u,v) in p:
          if (u,v) is in G: f(u,v) = f(u,v) + cf(p)
          else:          f(v,u) = f(v,u) - cf(p)
  return f (and the maximum flow is the net flow out of s)
